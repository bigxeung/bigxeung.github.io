<div style="text-align: justify;">I've always loved hip-hop music. When the show <i>Show Me the Money</i> was popular, I naturally started listening to the hip-hop that was trending at the time. As I explored more and more hip-hop, my interest grew deeper.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">At first, it was just a club activity, but my perspective changed after I enlisted in the military. Listening to Kanye West's <i>The College Dropout</i> on my earphones as a private was a cultural shock. Back then, I thought hip-hop was just about exciting raps, catchy melodies, and a cool lifestyle. I was truly stunned to realize that music could convey life itself.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">The way the melody and story intertwined in the album's climax, "Through the Wire," struck me like a flash of lightning. It was a sudden realization: 'Music isn't just the rapper's domain; it's the producer's canvas.'</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">From that day on, I decided to step away from being just a listener and become a creator. I spent my allowance on used MIDI equipment and started teaching myself how to use a DAW. Just as Kanye chopped and combined soul samples, I wanted to reinterpret all the sounds of the world in my own way. Now, I'm working hard to achieve my dream by listening to more music and making more music.</div>
