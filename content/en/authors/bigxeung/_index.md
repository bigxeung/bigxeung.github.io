I originally liked hip-hop music. When Show Me the Money was popular, I naturally came to listen to the hip-hop music that was popular at the time, and as I looked for and listened to various hip-hop music, my interest deepened.

Originally, I only continued with my club activities, but my thoughts changed after I joined the army. The 《College Dropout》 by Kanye West that flowed through my earphones when I was a private was a culture shock. At the time, hip-hop was just exciting rap, catchy melodies, and a cool lifestyle, but I was really shocked to learn that you can convey life through music.

In particular, the way the melody and story of the album's climax, “Through the Wire," were intertwined gave me a lightning-like realization. ‘Music is not just the domain of rappers, but the canvas of the producer who makes the beats.’

That day, I decided to step out of the listener's seat and become a creator. I spent my allowance on used MIDI equipment and started teaching myself how to use a DAW program. Just as Kanye broke down and combined soul, I wanted to reinterpret all the sounds of the world in my own way. So now I'm listening to more music, making more music, and working hard to achieve my dream.
