summary: "Why I Chose to Study Computer Science"

To me as a child, Iron Man was more than just a hero. I was less fascinated by his billionaire lifestyle and more by the genius of Tony Stark, who built his way out of a cave with a box of scraps. I was completely captivated by his power to change the world—the impact that knowledge could have. His conversations with the artificial intelligence, $\text{JARVIS}$, were a revelation. It wasn't just the flying suit I admired; it was the computer that augmented human intelligence—the **'power of code'**.

It was a natural path for me to major in computer science. Although I struggled with simple coding assignments at first, I finally found the blueprint for my dream as I took more courses. I decided to become a machine learning developer. The process, where data and algorithms learn on their own to find patterns, felt like I was implementing Tony Stark's way of understanding the world through code.

Working with deep learning frameworks, I began to design and train the very intelligence I had envisioned. The path wasn't always smooth, but the process was as thrilling as assembling the components of one of his suits. I'm no longer the child who dreamed of heroes; I've become the developer who builds a real-world 'JARVIS'. By solving the world's complex problems with artificial intelligence, I live with a sense of mission, feeling that just as Tony Stark did, I can make the world a better place through technology.
