summary: "Why I Started Producing"
---

Iâ€™ve always loved hip-hop music. When the show *Show Me the Money* was all the rage, I naturally started listening to the hip-hop that was popular at the time. As I sought out more and more tracks, my interest grew deeper.

At first, it was just a club activity, but my perspective changed after I enlisted in the military. As a Private First Class, hearing Kanye West's ***The College Dropout*** through my earphones was a cultural shock. Back then, I thought hip-hop was just about exciting raps, catchy melodies, and a cool lifestyle. I was truly stunned to learn that music could convey life itself.

The way the melody and story intertwined in the album's climax, "Through the Wire," struck me like a flash of lightning. It was a sudden realization: 'Music isn't just the rapper's domain; it's the producer's canvas.'

From that day on, I decided to step away from being a listener and become a creator. I spent my allowance on used MIDI equipment and started teaching myself how to use a DAW. Just as Kanye chopped and combined soul samples, I wanted to reinterpret all the sounds of the world in my own way. And so now, I'm working hard to achieve my dream by listening to more music and making more music.
