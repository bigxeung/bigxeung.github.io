### Locker Project


<div style="text-align: justify;">
For my Linux course, I developed a project to securely move all items from a password-protected folder (Locker A) to another secure folder (Locker B). The entire process is managed through the terminal, where a verified user can execute the transfer with simple commands after entering the correct password.
