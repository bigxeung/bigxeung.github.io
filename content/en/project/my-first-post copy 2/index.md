### Creating a Kiosk

<div style="text-align: justify;">
For my Object-Oriented Project course, I undertook a project to build a simple cafe kiosk capable of taking customer orders.

I integrated a server to store customer data, enabling features like a loyalty point system and user login.

Additionally, I implemented several detailed options, such as adding toppings and adjusting ice and sugar levels.
